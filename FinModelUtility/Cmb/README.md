- [@magcius](https://github.com/magcius), AKA Jasper, as their animated model viewer was used as the basis for the .csab importer.
- [@xdanieldzd](https://github.com/xdanieldzd), for reverse-engineering and documenting the .cmb and .csab formats. In addition, their [Scarlet](https://github.com/xdanieldzd/Scarlet) tool was referenced for dumping .gar files.
